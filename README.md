# üí´ About Me:
I am a graduate of Engineering and Construction Management with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My thesis focused on housing price interval forecasting using machine learning approaches, which sparked my interest in exploring the vast possibilities of AI.<br><br>For the past three years, I have been dedicated to learning and strengthening my skills in machine learning, with a particular interest in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). I have worked as a mentor at IMT Company for one year, where I honed my ability to guide others and deepen my understanding of the field. Additionally, I‚Äôve completed various personal projects involving banking data analysis, weather prediction, rice classification, stock price forecasting, and more.<br><br>Currently, I‚Äôm diving deeper into computer vision, aiming to apply it to industries such as sports and medicine to bring innovative ideas to life.<br><br>What drives me is the realization that learning never stops. Every project, challenge, and success is an opportunity to grow, and I‚Äôm excited to continue this journey of discovery in AI and machine learning.<br><br>If you‚Äôre interested in sharing ideas, collaborating, or exploring opportunities in the world of AI, let‚Äôs connect!
